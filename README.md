# ValheimMods


Casino Roll mod


A simple semi-configurable mod that could be used for a lottery / casino in Valheim. 

It has 2 simple commands: 
-- /rollrules - posts in chat the general rules of the game / lottery / casino (full message can be configured in Configuration Manager)
-- /roll - posts a message and gives a random number between 1 and 100 (full message can be configured in Configuration Manager)


For any additional features, just give me a sign :)
